\section{Experience}
\cventry{2015--2016}{Student Intern}{Sandia National Laboratories}{Livermore, CA}{}{%General description no longer than 1--2 lines.\newline{}%
Detailed achievements:%
\begin{itemize}%
\item Researched practical applications of Shamir secret sharing and Write-Optimized Data Structures applied to network event tracking.
\item Designed and implemented a write-optimized database for storing network events.
\item Resulted in two publications.
\end{itemize}}

\section{Current Work}
\textbf{Classifying IoT Devices From DNS Traffic}: My current work focuses on using campus network data and IoT device captures to classify IoT devices on campus. We are training an online, linear classifier to detect IoT devices from the DNS requests that pass through a software switch. This work can then be scaled up to ISP-level classification of IoT devices and may lead to security and privacy implications for IoT devices.

\section{Teaching}
\cvitem{Fall 2016 -- present}{COS 126 TA:
Many students come to this course with no CS background and require lots of attention to keep up in the course. I have hosted additional review sessions and office hours to help struggling students to better learn the material. I try to get students interested in CS and motivate the material.}
%\cventry{Summer 2017}{Near Peer Mentor}{Princeton University}{}{%General description no longer than 1--2 lines.\newline{}%
%Mentored an REU student from a nearby University. Students were paired with mentors of varying backgrounds to supply new perspectives on their research.}
%\cventry{Summer 2017}{Princeton Summer Programming Mentor}{Princeton University}{}{%General description no longer than 1--2 lines.\newline{}%
%Mentored a group of undergraduate students who were tasked with creating a social media app to meet new friends. The students had no prior experience with databases, servers, or app development.}
